The codes accompanying the above publication. 

The folder fast_schroedinger_codes/ contains the main codes required for the fast and oblivious algorithm. 

The folder linear_example contains the linear example from the paper: run "test_schrodinger_lin".
The folder nonlinear_example containes the nonlinear Schroedinger with concentrated potentials 
example from the paper: run "test_schrodinger_nonlin".
