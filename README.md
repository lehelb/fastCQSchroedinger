# Fast-CQ-Schroedinger
Codes accompanying the publication:

Fast and oblivious algorithms for Schroedinger equation with concentrated potentials
by Lehel Banjai and Maria Lopez-Fernandez

downloadable from https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01292.

The folder fast_schroedinger_codes/ contains the main codes required for the fast and oblivious algorithm. 

The folder linear_example contains the linear example from the paper: run "test_schrodinger_lin".

The folder nonlinear_example contains the nonlinear Schroedinger with concentrated potentials 
example from the paper: run "test_schrodinger_nonlin". It assumes that the Matlab package of 
Marcel Leutenegger computing the error function for complex arguments is installed, see:
